                Hi, my name is Jatinder Singh Khaira; I am 22 years old and I completed my undergrad in Comp. Sci. from
                Carleton University. Before anything is said about me, I just want to state that I just love cars and I
                am a massive petrolhead. I am a very artistic and aspirant person and I have always had big goals for
                myself; I believe in never settling for less. Ever since I was a child, I always believed in making a
                differnece and bringing about positive change in this world. As I grew older, I learned that technology
                is the medium of rapid change and empowerment. I get my artistic side of things from my love for cars; I
                love to draw, sketch, model, and paint cars.
            </p>
            <p>
                From a very young age I started using our family computer and I was alwaya curious and fascinated about
                the inner workings of a computer. Later on in life, I grew more interest in computers when my family
                started the IT company. That made realize the impotance of technology and how much the world needs it.
                Our comapny went global and the different experiences from different countries had me brainstroming
                different ideas of what I can do in the field of IT. I then went ahead and did my undergrad in Comp.
                Sci. and since we dealt with a majority of clients that have web based requirements, I decided to start
                my journey from the web.
